# E-Learning Platform API

A comprehensive RESTful API for an E-Learning platform built with Node.js, TypeScript, and SQL Server. This platform enables students to enroll in courses, track their progress, and allows instructors to manage their content effectively.

## Features

### üîê Authentication & User Management
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- User registration and login with password hashing
- Password reset functionality via email
- Profile management for users

**Note on Password Reset:**
For simplicity and testing purposes, the password reset functionality currently returns the reset token directly in the API response instead of sending it via email. In a production environment, this token would be sent to the user's email address. The email functionality could be implemented using services like Nodemailer with SMTP configuration.

### üìö Course Management
- Complete CRUD operations for courses
- Lesson management within courses
- Course categorization and filtering
- Course status management (draft, published, archived)

### üéì Enrollment & Progress Tracking
- Student enrollment/unenrollment system
- Progress tracking for individual lessons
- Course completion percentage calculation
- Instructor analytics for student progress

### ‚≠ê Review System
- Course ratings and reviews
- Review management (create, update, delete)
- Average rating calculations

### üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Dashboard
- Platform statistics and analytics
- User management and status updates
- System-wide overview

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this e-learning platform, i encountered several interesting challenges that shaped approach:

### SQL Server Integration
Working with SQL Server and Sequelize ORM required some specific configuration and troubleshooting, especially around connection pooling, transaction management, and handling SQL Server-specific data types and constraints.

### Progress Tracking Logic
Building an accurate progress tracking system that calculates completion percentages across multiple lessons and courses was more complex than initially anticipated. I had to handle edge cases like partial completions, course updates affecting existing enrollments, and ensuring data consistency.

## Assumptions

I made several assumptions during the development process that influenced my design decisions:

### User Behavior Assumptions
- Students typically enroll in multiple courses and progress through them sequentially
- Instructors create courses with multiple lessons and want to track student engagement
- Admins need comprehensive oversight and management capabilities

### Technical Assumptions
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration provide adequate security without frequent re-authentication
- Winston logging with file rotation will handle application monitoring and debugging
- Express.js middleware stack (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting) provides sufficient security measures
- Connection pooling with max 5 connections will handle moderate concurrent database operations
- Environment-based configuration (development/production) will manage different deployment scenarios

### Business Logic Assumptions
- Course completion is determined by completing all lessons within a course
- Progress is tracked at the lesson level, with course progress calculated as an aggregate
- Reviews can only be submitted by enrolled students who have made some progress
- Password reset tokens are time-limited and single-use

### Security Assumptions
- JWT tokens provide sufficient security for API authentication
- Rate limiting and input validation are adequate for preventing abuse
- Database connections are secure and properly configured
- Environment variables are properly managed in production deployments

### Scalability Assumptions
- The current database schema can handle moderate user loads
- Connection pooling and query optimization will handle increased traffic
- The modular architecture allows for easy feature additions and modifications
